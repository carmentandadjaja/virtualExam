# Virtual Exam
Systems Design Class Senior Project <br>

<h2> What is this </h2>
This web application is made during my senior year of college in the Systems Design class. We worked in a team of five students building an automated Testing Center called Virtual Exam where teachers can log in and create tests and students can also log in and take the tests in classes they are signed up for and have the tests graded automatically.<br>
Students can then check the grades they got and the average score for a particular class where teachers can see the average score of the class they are assigned to.<br>
This project is mainly created using ASP.NET, C#, SQL Server, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap.

<h2> What I did </h2>
I am mainly responsible for the front-end part of the website, working on landing pages for both student and teaher, designing how the page looks during test creation, etc. and occasionally working with the backend guys on making connections to the database, sending data from the database and getting data back.
